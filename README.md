# keepers-of-the-commons
*A (cc) song about Creative Commons, inspired by a user request at the #ccsummit 2017 in Toronto*

> My name is Jer and I'm here to say 
>
> You need to license content in an open way
> 
> A keeper of the commons, you must be
> If you love something beautiful, set it free
> 
> You might think that you can keep control
> 
> But that ship has sailed we've got to let it go
> 
> Keepers of the commons, we must be
> 
> If we love something beautiful, we set it free
> 
> Creative Commons is the framework I choose
> 
> Check out the clauses, pick the one that're right for you
> 
> A keeper of the commons, I will be
> 
> If I love something beautiful, I'll set it free
